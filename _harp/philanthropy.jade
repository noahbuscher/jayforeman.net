        | In 2013, Jay Foreman founded The Foreman Foundation, a 501c3
        | non-profit organization, which strives to enhance the lives of people
        | living with diabetes. The Foreman Foundation gives both youth and adults
        | an opportunity to access top notch education and resources to help their
        | fight against diabetes. With many family and friends affected by diabetes,
        | Mr. Foreman and the Foreman Foundation are committed to helping find a
        | cure for diabetes.
      p.thick  
        | The Foreman Foundation will host charity events, football camps and an
        | annual gala. Our focus is on raising funds in efforts to fight diabetes
        | as well as bringing awareness to communities in regards to this terrible
        | disease. We believe, with the proper education and research, a cure
        | for diabetes can be found.
